=====

BMO! is just a silly test program I wrote to try the
[CMT](https://github.com/gnebehay/CMT) tracker, and use the
QtDeclarative/QML framework.

You need:

- CMT.py/util.py from the [CMT](https://github.com/gnebehay/CMT) git repo,
- PySide
- OpenCV 

Start with:

```
./run.py
```

The BMO character from Adventure Time will then simply look at you as
you move.
